# Karbon

**Karbon** is a visual performance system built in Unity for the music event
[UNDERCITY], held on March 17, 2026.

[UNDERCITY]: https://www.liquidroom.net/schedule/undercity_20260317

The project uses the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and a suite of custom
visual effects to transform live camera feeds into stylized visual
compositions.

## System Requirements

- Unity 6.3 LTS
- USB Video Class (UVC)-compatible capture device
- Novation Launchpad X or Launchpad Pro

Notes:

- UVC-compatible capture devices typically appear to the system as webcams.
  The setup used for the event relied on a [Roland UVC-01], but similar
  devices should also work. A standard webcam can be used as well.
- Polyphonic aftertouch is required for effect control. The Launchpad Mini is
  not sufficient because it does not support MPE.

## Project Structure

The project is organized around a layered multi-camera rendering setup. Each
visual stage, such as `02 Flipbook`, `03 VFX`, and `04 Burn`, is rendered by
its own dedicated camera into a separate `RenderTexture`. The numeric prefixes
are used to keep these stage directories ordered in the Project window. The
resulting textures are then composited in `10 Composite` to produce the final
output.

`CustomRenderTexture` is also used to process the input video stream.

The project uses [BodyPixSentis] to generate a human segmentation mask, which
is combined with the input video color data in the `Prefilter` shader.
